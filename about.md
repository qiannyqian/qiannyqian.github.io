You can call me Hui Qian, although most of my friends just call me Qian :)

My background is kind of a funny story, because how many Psychology graduates turned marketing execs turned web developers do you know?

I'm keen on the tech startups, addicted to coffee, hungry to learn about full stack (Ruby on Rails) and web (HTML, CSS, JS, maybe even React) development, and passionate about food.

In my free time, I lift weights, climb rocks, and code.

Always up for a casual chat over coffee, but if I'm not in town, you can also find me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/qiannyqianhere).

If you need to get in touch, you can drop me a line [here](mailto:liang.huiqian@gmail.com).
