You can call me Hui Qian, although most of my friends just call me Qian :) 
July 2017 Graduate of NEXT Academy and currently based in Kuala Lumpur.

My background is kind of a funny story, because how many Psychology graduates turned marketing execs turned web developers do you know?

I'm keen on tech startups, addicted to coffee, hungry to learn about full stack (Ruby on Rails) and web (HTML, CSS, JS, maybe even React) development, and passionate about food. I am currently also one of the organisers and mentors at [Rails Girls KL](https://www.facebook.com/railsgirlskl/).

In my free time, I lift weights, climb rocks, and conduct karaoke sessions in my car.

Always up for a casual chat over coffee, but if I'm not in town, you can find me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/qiannyqianhere) or you can drop me a line [here](mailto:liang.huiqian@gmail.com).
