title: Singapore: Sink or Swim
---

On the day I sent back my second signed job contract, my friend texted me (in our group chat):

> "So happy!!! Qian!!! You fucking soldier you."

Countless friends had, upon receiving my news, been (to put it mildly) ecstatic for me.

> "Wah so lucky, so proud of youu :'))"

> "Mad respect for you"

> "Homegirl moving up in lyf
>  Well done brah"

I have these messages of congratulations saved in my WhatsApp starred messages - whenever I feel down about myself, or find myself doubting my work, I look to these messages for encouragement and inspiration.

Becoming a junior developer hasn't been easy, let alone securing a job in a foreign country. 

This is the story of how I made it to the Lion City, Singapore.

"I know that you applied for the role of Front-End Engineer, however that role isn't actually too urgent for us at the moment."

We will be able to convert you to a tech role, however could you first come in to do another non-tech role for us?

It seemed like a great stepping stone - working for a startup in Singapore, where I could finally earn more, live independently, and start a new chapter in life.

Instead, it turned out to be a nightmare that lasted nearly half a year.

I'll not dwell on the previous company, or it's management. I will, however, say that when things are too good to be true - they usually are. 

I figured, look, I'm unhappy, but let's just tough it out - after all, it is in my contract that I will be converted to a tech role after a certain period of time.

Once April came around, I started asking about my change of role, asking management when would that be.

My meeting with them was postponed from one week to another - this charade lasted 1 whole month.

Eventually, I got them on a call, and I knew that nothing good would come of it.

However, once I was told that I "won't be confirmed, as we are trimming the workforce of the company", I immediately 

	1. Panicked
	2. Started strategizing on how I could find a new job within the limited time frame of 30 days

As a Malaysian in Singapore on an Employment Pass (EP), once my work visa is cancelled by the employer, I will effectively only have 30 days to stay in Singapore, before I'm booted out/forced to leave by ICA.

The only silver lining of being let go, is that although they did not have to, my previous company agreed that my last day would be the end of May - I was told that this would effectively be my last month.

And thus began 1 month of contacting friends and acquaintances for contacts that they might have, going through numerous phone screenings, attempting various technical tests, and finally getting the job offer I had been aiming for before Singapore - a developer role.

To be frank, job searching is a numbers game - the higher the number of applications you send through, the more phone screenings you get through, the more technical tests you go through, and eventually a handful will turn into the final round, and thus, that job offer.

Even with quite a number of contacts who were so very lovely and helpful (there was 1 person alone connected me with at least 8 people to talk to!), what really mattered in securing a job in tech is, aside from performing well in interviews, is nailing your technical assessments.

I will admit, I am not strong in front-end frameworks, and my back end knowledge is currently paltry at best. I wasn't anyone's ideal developer candidate. I knew what skills I had, would not be a good fit for most roles that were being advertised.

Impostor syndrome hit me hard and fast, but at the same time, I did not have the mental capacity to doubt myself - it was sink or swim time, and I would be damned if I let myself sink so fast after barely getting into Singapore.

In the end, for my current role, I completed 2 completely separate tasks, assessed by 2 different people. This also discounts the 1st phone screening, and the 2nd final round of interviews with them.

I made sure that the mockups were done up to par of the specifications given to me, and for the second one, I went beyond the scope and gave 2 examples of work so they could assess me on both.

I was given notice on May 3rd. 

I signed and sent back my job offer on May 31st.

In between, there was a lot of self doubt, panicking, and anxiety attacks. 

But there was also the endless, countless encouragement from friends and family, and my sheer stubborn willpower which refused to give up - I've already made it this far, I'm not giving up now.

As I write this, I am nearly done with completing my first 2 months in my new company, doing what I like - development work, specifically front end.

I wrote this on the suggestion of said friend from the start - so that I could document what I've gone through.

Perhaps by telling my story, I can hope to inspire someone out there who needs a little help to get through a tough time as well.
