Couple of weekends ago I not only mentored at Rails Girls KL, 
but also delivered 2 talks: one on how the internet works, and another lightning talk on how I got started on my coding journey. 

Definitely a huge push out of my comfort zone but worth it for the experience! 

Many thanks to Faezrah for bringing me into the organising committee and also encouraging me to go for it and give the talks!

Here's to getting more women in tech! ðŸ’ª
