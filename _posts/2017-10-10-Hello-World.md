Many thanks to [Barry Clark](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) for providing this easy way of getting simple static pages up!

This will be my first time running my own personal website and portfolio, and I'm hoping to populate it soon once I'm done with my last two weeks at NEXT Academy.

More to come soon!
